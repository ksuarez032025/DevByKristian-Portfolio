            <h2>Career Experience & Technical Growth</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, I’m a developer with a background in credit unions, payments, and problem-solving.
              With over 14 years of experience in the financial services industry, I built my career leading card
              operations, payments
              processing, and fraud mitigation at the credit union level. As the Card Services Manager at Empower
              Federal Credit
              Union, I was responsible for overseeing Mastercard credit and debit card programs, managing vendor
              relationships and
              product conversions.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my most impactful contributions came through close collaboration with our internal application
              services team. I served as a bridge between card operations and technical teams—testing new workflows,
              validating daily
              file generation processes, and ensuring API integrations were mapped accurately to the correct data
              points. I worked
              hands-on with
              system functionality, catching errors before they reached production, and helping translate operational
              needs into clean
              technical executions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my career, I regularly collaborated with departments across the credit union, including
              accounting for
              chargebacks and daily settlement tracking, commercial lending (business credit cards), compliance,
              internal audit, and
              lending quality control. My passion for understanding how people interact with systems became my greatest
              strength: bridging human workflows with the technologies that powered them.
              <br />
              <br />
              That drive to solve operational challenges through streamlined tech solutions is what ultimately sparked
              my transition
              into coding and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I’m focused on front-end development through SheCodes, learning to build responsive, accessible
              websites using
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My background taught me how to identify process pain points and work
              across teams to
              implement system-level solutions and that same mindset now shapes my approach to development.
              From building user-first designs to integrating APIs, I’m excited to fuse my financial expertise with
              modern web
              technologies to create intuitive, scalable, and secure digital experiences that make an impact.

            <h4>Staying Centered in a Fast-Paced World</h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mb-2">
              Working in the fast-paced world of finance, payments, and now tech, I’ve come to value the importance of
              staying
              grounded. While I thrive on challenge and change, maintaining balance is essential for staying energized,
              focused, and
              at my best—for myself, my family, and my work.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              My reset button lives in the garden. A space that reminds me to slow down, reconnect, and return to what
              matters. Whether
              I’m outside with my husband and our dogs or teaching my son how to grow food, cook, and bake from scratch,
              these moments
              keep me centered. They reflect the same values I bring to my work: patience, curiosity, and intention.
